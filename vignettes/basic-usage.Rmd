# fid_monitor

You can use `fid_monitor()` to monitor the feed intake of each pig in the nedap or fire pig performance test station as well as the total feed intake of all pigs.


```{r examples-fid_monitor, warning = FALSE}
# Load CSV data
data <- data.table::fread("C:/Users/Dell/Documents/projects/pptsdm_data/ppt_monitor_test_data.csv")
# Feed intake monitor
fid_monitor(data = data, station_type = "nedap", save_path = "C:/Users/Dell/Downloads/test")
```

This first section shows:

- the three parts necessary for a package: 'function', 'examples' and 'tests'.  
  + Note that the three following chunks have names accordingly.

-->
```

```{=html}
<!--
Here is an example on how to use the function.
This should be a reproducible and working example
-->
```

# station_monitor

You can use function of `station_monitor()` to monitor pig performance test data from nedap and fire pig performance test stations. This function can monitor the changes in the number of pigs, total visitation time of pigs, total number of visits, changes in total feed intake, and also monitor the changes in pig weights for a specific pig performance test station.


```{r examples-station_monitor}
# Load CSV data
data <- data.table::fread("C:/Users/Dell/Documents/projects/pptsdm_data/ppt_monitor_test_data.csv")
# Station monitor
station_monitor(data = data, station_type = "nedap", save_path = "C:/Users/Dell/Downloads/test")
```

# table_monitor

\`table_monitor\` serves as a complement to two other monitoring functions. It primarily aims to analyze and monitor, based on the CSV data from the past n days of measurement stations, the daily counts of missing records, extreme weight recordings, total feeding time at each measurement station, total feeding amount per pen per day, average weight per pen per day, and feed intake information in each hour.


```{r examples-table_monitor}
# Load CSV data
data <- data.table::fread("C:/Users/Dell/Desktop/test/monitor_test_data.csv")
# Monitor station and data
res <- table_monitor(data = data, save_path = "C:/Users/Dell/Desktop/test")
# Monitor the number of times 'na' appears in the last 7 days
res$responder_na
# Monitor the percentage of extreme weight records in the last 7 days
res$extreme_weight
# Monitor the visiting time and frequency of pigs in the last 7 days
res$feed_time_n
# Monitor the total feed intake over the last 7 days
res$all_feedintake
# Monitor the average feed intake over the last 7 days
res$mean_feedintake
# Monitor the average weight per pen over the last 7 days
res$house_weight
# Monitor visit time in each hour over the last 1 day.
res$visit_n
# Monitor feed intake time in each hour over the last 1 day.
res$feed_time
# Monitor feed intake in each hour over the last 1 day.
res$feed_intake
```

# monitor_schedule

You can use `monitor_schedule` to set when to run the `fid_monitor()`、`station_monitor()` and `table_monitor()`.


```{r examples-monitor_schedule}
# Set monitor task
monitor_schedule(
  taskname = "ppt_csv_monitor",
  schedule = "DAILY",
  starttime = "10:05",
  startdate = format(Sys.Date(), "%Y/%m/%d"),
  rscript_args = list(house_width = "1", 
                      days = 7,
                      begin_date = "2024-05-01", 
                      csv_path = "C:/Users/Dell/Desktop/test/NonEmptyCSVs",
                      save_path = "C:/Users/Dell/Desktop/test"))
# Delete monitor task
taskscheduleR::taskscheduler_delete("ppt_csv_monitor")
```

That's it ! This the end of the documented story of our package. All components are there.
