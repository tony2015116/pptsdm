# fid_monitor

You can use `fid_monitor()` to monitor the feed intake of each pig in the nedap or fire pig performance test station as well as the total feed intake of all pigs.


```{r examples-fid_monitor}
data <- data.table::fread("C:/Users/Dell/Downloads/test/ppt_test_data.csv")
fid_monitor(data = data, station_type = "nedap", save_path = "C:/Users/Dell/Downloads/test")
```

<!-- 
This first section shows:

- the three parts necessary for a package: 'function', 'examples' and 'tests'.  
  + Note that the three following chunks have names accordingly.

```

```{=html}
<!--
Here is an example on how to use the function.
This should be a reproducible and working example
-->
```

# station_monitor

You can use function of `station_monitor()` to monitor pig performance test data from nedap and fire pig performance test stations. This function can monitor the changes in the number of pigs, total visitation time of pigs, total number of visits, changes in total feed intake, and also monitor the changes in pig weights for a specific pig performance test station.


```{r examples-station_monitor}
data <- data.table::fread("C:/Users/Dell/Downloads/test/ppt_test_data.csv")
station_monitor(data = data, station_type = "nedap", save_path = "C:/Users/Dell/Downloads/test")
```

# monitor_schedule

You can use `monitor_schedule` to set when to run the `fid_monitor()` and \`station_monitor()\`.


```{r examples-monitor_schedule}
monitor_schedule(
  taskname = "ppt_csv_monitor",
  schedule = "DAILY",
  starttime = "10:05",
  startdate = format(Sys.Date(), "%Y/%m/%d"),
  rscript_args = list(begin_date = "2023-05-01", 
                      csv_path = "C:/Users/Dell/Downloads/test",
                      save_path = "C:/Users/Dell/Downloads/test"))
```

That's it ! This the end of the documented story of our package. All components are there.
