# Description of your package

This will fill the description of your package.
Fill and run the content of this chunk, before anything else. 

Note: when you will use other flat templates, this part will be in a separate file. Do not be surprised!

# Feed intake monitor of pigs

This is the first tool of our wonderful package. You can add `1` to any `value` using function `fid_monitor()`.


```{=html}
<!-- 
This first section shows:

- the three parts necessary for a package: 'function', 'examples' and 'tests'.  
  + Note that the three following chunks have names accordingly.

-->
```

```{=html}
<!--
Here is an example on how to use the function.
This should be a reproducible and working example
-->
```

# Station monitor

```{r examples-station_monitor}
data <- data.table::fread("C:/Users/Dell/Downloads/test/ppt_test_data.csv")
station_monitor(data = data, station_type = "nedap", save_path = "C:/Users/Dell/Downloads/test")
```

This is the first tool of our wonderful package. You can add `1` to any `value` using function `station_monitor()`.


# Growth curve monitor

This is the first tool of our wonderful package. You can add `1` to any `value` using function `growth_monitor()`.


```{r examples-growth_monitor}
data <- data.table::fread("C:/Users/Dell/Downloads/test/ppt_test_data.csv")
growth_monitor(data = data, save_path = "C:/Users/Dell/Downloads/test")
```

That's it ! This the end of the documented story of our package. All components are there.

# Inflate your package

You're one inflate from paper to box.
Build your package from this very Rmd using `fusen::inflate()`

```

```{=html}
<!-- 
- Verify your `"DESCRIPTION"` file has been updated
- Verify your function is in `"R/"` directory
- Verify your test is in `"tests/testthat/"` directory
- Verify this Rmd appears in `"vignettes/"` directory
